# SyntacticLexical-Compiler

A collaborative Java-based lexical and syntactic compiler.

The main features of the project include:
- Error handling on a line-by-line basis: Implemented a robust error handling mechanism that detects and reports errors at the specific line of code.
- File reading capabilities: Integrated file reading functionality to allow the compiler to read and process source code from external files.
- Quadruple generation from source code: Developed a module that analyzes the source code and generates intermediate representation in the form of quadruples.
- New identifier analysis: Expanded the compiler's identifier analysis capabilities by incorporating support for new identifiers, allowing the compiler to recognize and handle a broader range of variables, functions, and other language constructs.
- Enhanced symbol table management: Upgraded the symbol table management system to efficiently handle the new identifiers, providing accurate scope resolution, variable tracking, and semantic analysis throughout the compilation process.
